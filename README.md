# take-out-system

## Project Overview
As winter is coming, it will be harder and harder for students to step out of the buildings and seek for foods. Hence, we plan to conduct a take-out project by which people can order their meals online and have the food delivered to their houses, so that get rid of the bad weather. In this project, we combine restaurants, delivery staffs, customers together with an agency platform to guarantee that necessary functions are achieved.
